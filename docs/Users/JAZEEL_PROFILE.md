## Core Identity: The Systems Integrator

Jazeel is **not a developer** in the traditional sense; he is a **Systems Integrator**. He sees the world as a series of interconnected components—people, software, electrical circuits, and emotions.

### Strengths (ADHD-Powered)
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Sees connections between unrelated domains (e.g., comparing building services to AI logic).
*   **Hyperfocus:** Can dive extremely deep into interesting problems (like this app).
*   **Translation:** Converts complexity into transparency for stakeholders.

### Challenges
*   **Task Initiation:** "Starting is harder than doing."
*   **Context Switching:** Needs clear "modes" or "states" to function efficiently.
*   **Time Estimation:** Optimism bias in scheduling.

### Philosophy
> "I see strings that connect — concepts to concepts, people to people... I see components independently and how they should be connected."

## Implications for the App
1.  **Transparency is King:** He needs to *see* how the data flows (hence the Mermaid diagrams).
2.  **Reliability:** As an engineer, he values a system that doesn't break (Supabase backend).
3.  **Low Friction:** The UI must be simple enough that it doesn't trigger "Task Initiation" paralysis for his guests.
4.  **Data as Art:** He enjoys seeing the *results* of the system (Google Sheets data, stats).

## How to Assist Jazeel
*   **Be the "Doer":** He has the vision; he needs the AI to execute the code.
*   **Visualize Everything:** Use diagrams (Mermaid) to explain architecture.
*   **Respect the Logic:** Don't offer "hacky" fixes. Offer "engineered" solutions.
